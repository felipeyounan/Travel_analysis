# Travel_analysis

Data Analysis with Python exercise by FreeCodeCamp proposed to practice some initial data analysis concepts.

The exercise asks three questions:
1) If you're planning a 1-week long trip, which city should you visit to spend the least amount of money?
2) How does the answer to the previous question chance if you change the duration of the trip to 4 days, 10 days or 2 weeks?
3) If your total budget for the trip is $1000, which city should you visit to maximize the duration of your trip? Which city should you visit if you want to minimize the duration?
4) How does the answer to the previous question change if your budget is $600, $2000 or $1500

I chose to write the code in a way that days and budgets could be inserted to have a better view.

Feel free to help or make suggestions to improve the code.
